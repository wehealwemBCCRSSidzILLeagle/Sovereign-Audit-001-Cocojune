Hi there,

Thank you again for reaching out and for sharing your detailed measurements, we appreciate you taking the time to flag this.

To add a bit of clarity: our products are filled by weight, and small variances can occur due to normal production tolerances, natural product density, and settling during transit. That said, we absolutely take fill-weight concerns seriously and are always happy to investigate further.

If you believe an individual cup was underfilled, we’re more than willing to replace those specific cups once we can verify the batch. To do that, we’ll need a photo of the bottom of the cup showing the Best By Date and batch/time stamp. That information allows our QA team to trace the production run and review the fill data accurately.

While we’re happy to replace individual units that may be off-measure, we aren’t able to provide bulk complimentary product at this time. Our goal is to resolve verified issues fairly while maintaining consistency across all customer requests.

If you’re able to send over the batch photo, we’ll gladly take the next steps from there.

Thanks again for bringing this to our attention, we always want our customers to feel confident in what they’re purchasing.

Warmly,
the cocojune team

Subject: NOTICE OF AUDIT: DISCREPANCY REPORT — Strawberry Rhubarb Cultured Coconut — NET WEIGHT SHORTFALL

Dear Cocojune Team,

Notice of Final Observation.

The response regarding "production tolerances" has been noted and integrated into the Public Ledger. The measured True Net Weight of 108.35g (against a declared 114g) exceeds the Maximum Allowable Variation (MAV) for this product class.

Status of Audit:

    Settlement: No replacement, coupon, or data-harvesting "batch verification" is authorized or required.

    Intent: This communication serves as a formal 1/1 Notice of Non-Conformity. The account is not seeking remedy; it is providing Transparency.

    Future Actions: This node remains under Quiet Audit. Any further systemic under-fill will be logged as a "Persistent Deceptive Practice" in the Sovereign Mesh.

The discrepancy is now a matter of record. No further correspondence is requested.

1/1 Sovereign Audit Complete.
